<h2 id="the-tasks">The Tasks</h2>
<h3 id="task-0-makefile-0-marks">Task 0: Makefile <small>0 marks</small></h3>
<p>Write (or modify!) a Makefile for the bonus component, which should be capable of producing <code>assn2Bonus</code>. We will be using your Makefile to compile your assignment for automarking; if you do not provide one, or yours cannot produce <code>assn2Bonus</code>, you will receive 0 for the automarking.</p>
<h3 id="task-1-thief-strategy-implementation-2-marks">Task 1: Thief Strategy Implementation <small>2 marks</small></h3>
<p>You must modify the assn2 program and implement a strategy for the thief.</p>
<p>Assume the thief has a map of the cities and knows where the getaway location is. Also assume that the thief knows the location of each detective, but does not know the strategy or stamina of the agent. Also assume that for this part of the assignment no detectives will be using random strategy. The thief does not know where the informants for the detectives are.</p>
<p>The aim is to implement a clever strategy for the thief that increases the liklihood of getting away, or at least holding off being caught for as long as possible.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-diary-0-marks">Task 2: Diary <small>0 marks</small></h3>
<p>You must maintain an <code>assn2BonusDiary.txt</code>, as with the normal version of the assignment. You will need to provide an entry in it to explain your strategy and the basics of how it works. You will lose 1 mark if it is missing or empty.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>This will be run as a competition.</p>
<p>All entries, along with the original random thief from the <code>assn2Model</code> will be run in different situations.</p>
<p>Different situations will include different maps, different starting locations, different seeds, different detective strategies etc.</p>
<p>Any submissions that do not follow the rules of the game will be disqualified. If they seem like a serious attempt that unintentionally broke the rules, they will get 0.5 marks, but will not be run during the competition.</p>
<p>During the competition, the number of times the thief gets away will be recorded. The number of times the thief is caught will also be recorded, along with as the number of hours the thief can resist being caught by the detectives in situations when the thief gets caught or time runs out..</p>
<p>The score is calculated by the number of getaways minus the number of times the thief is caught.</p>
<p>The person with the highest score wins. In cases of ties, the total number of hours the thief resisted being caught will be taken into account.</p>
<h2 id="marks">Marks</h2>
<p>Marks will be given as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Winner 2/2</li>
<li>Second 1.9/2</li>
<li>Third 1.8/2</li>
<li>Fourth 1.6/2</li>
<li>Fifth 1.5/2</li>
</ol>
<p>Any other entries that can beat the Random Thief will be given a score of 1.</p>
<p>Any other serious attempts that do not beat the Random Thief will get 0.5.</p>

<p>All work submitted for this assignment must be your own work and it must be completed individually. We regard copying of assignments, in whole or part, as a serious offence.</p>
<p>We use plagiarism detection software to search for multiply-submitted work and work that is similar to programs found on the Internet and other sources.</p>
<p>Be warned:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The submission of work derived from another person, or jointly written with someone else, will, at the very least, result in automatic failure for COMP1927 with a mark of zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Allowing another student to copy from you will, at the very least, result in a mark of zero for your own assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Accidentally publishing your code on public source code sharing services like Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, or Codeplex is not a valid excuse for your code being copied; you will be prosecuted as will students who copy your work. Many services provide private source code repositories free or at low cost for students.</p></li>
<li><p>Severe or second offences will result in automatic failure, exclusion from the University, and possibly other academic discipline.</p></li>
<li><p>Group submissions will not be allowed. Your program must be entirely your own work.</p></li>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>You need to submit your assignment using the <code>give</code> command on a CSE machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ 1927 classrun 17x1 give assn2Bonus *.c *.h Makefile assn2BonusDiary.txt</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Heads-up!</strong> You must submit <code>assn2Bonus</code> to join the bonus round.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Hint</strong> Careful construction of your assignment solution will let you share code and a Makefile between both <code>assn2</code> and <code>assn2Bonus</code>.
