As you complete your work on this assignment, you must maintain an
assignment diary where you will reflect on what you have done. In a text
file called assn2Diary.txt, place the date and time of your work
together with some brief comments of the work you have completed such as
what you worked on, what you accomplished and what bugs you fixed.

You should discuss your choices of data structures and additional ADTs
you have used in your implementation. It should also discuss how you
have tested your implementation.

You may like to base your assignment diary on logs from a version
control system, like Git or Subversion. Make sure your commit messages
are informative!


Jan 14 2017
set up assign2 git repository, set up assign2Diary.txt
create branch 'task0' for Task0
add testGraph.c to branch task0

Jan 15-20 2017
add more test cases to task0
read spec and lecture slides to understand graph's implementation
also research and design the graph representation struct

Jan 21 2017
consolidate Graph theory and implementation
understand each representation pros and cons
apply the optimised 2d array graph representation for assignment2
go through the graph.c and implement graph init function

Reasons for 2D array representation:
The map of city is weighted graph, it is easy record the weight of each
edge.
Adapt the optimised 2D array because the graph is undirected graph, it
can be stored only once in triangle matrix.


Jan 22 2017
Finish Graph.c prototype
