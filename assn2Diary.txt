As you complete your work on this assignment, you must maintain an
assignment diary where you will reflect on what you have done. In a text
file called assn2Diary.txt, place the date and time of your work
together with some brief comments of the work you have completed such as
what you worked on, what you accomplished and what bugs you fixed.

You should discuss your choices of data structures and additional ADTs
you have used in your implementation. It should also discuss how you
have tested your implementation.

You may like to base your assignment diary on logs from a version
control system, like Git or Subversion. Make sure your commit messages
are informative!
