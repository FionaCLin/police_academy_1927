/*
 *Task 0: Graph Black-Box Unit Testing 4 marks
 * You must write a testGraph.c that tests the functions defined in the
 * given Graph.h file. You must create assert(3)-based tests. We run
 * your testGraph.c code with our own working and broken graph
 * implementations to check they pass and fail the implementations
 * accordingly.
 *
 * Only use and test functions from the original Graph.h. Do not need to
 * submit tests for any additional functions you add to your graph when
 * you complete the other tasks of the assignment.
 *
 * You do not need assert(3)-based tests for the functions show or
 * destroyGraph.
